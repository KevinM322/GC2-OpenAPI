This is a project to connect a Foresight GC2 through Bluetooth to Open API on GS Pro and other golf simulator software. To use, download the latest release (currently at https://github.com/KevinM322/GC2-OpenAPI/releases/tag/v0.1). Launch GC2.Bluetooth.exe. Use "Open API" in GS Pro. The GC2.Bluetooth.exe can be launched before or after GS Pro. All shots will be saved in shots.dat in the same directory as the GC2.Bluetooth.exe file.
